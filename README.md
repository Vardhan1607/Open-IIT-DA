A major record label wants to purchase the rights to a music track. It does not want to encounter any losses with promotion and distribution of the track. It needs to decide on the royalties to be paid to the artists and composers. Objective: You need to predict the popularity of the music tracks based on the features provided in the dataset. The target variable, “popularity”, has 5 categories: ‘Very high’, ‘high’, ‘average’, ‘low’, ‘very low’. The order is in decreasing popularity. For each category, there is initial bid price (for royalties to be paid) and expected revenue collections(in 10k $)  Scoring: Based on the predictions, 10000(in 10k $) will be invested to place bids on the 4000 music tracks. The model should generate the highest possible revenue.
